# Synning

[Synesthesia](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/synesthesia) is an overlapping of senses that is involuntary and consistent over time. For example, I perceive sounds, letters, and numbers as distinct colors and units of time as shapes on sort of an imaginary rotary. This app is a crude experiment to see how closely I can translate my experience with synesthesia into something I can share with others. Since synesthesia is differnet for everyone who experiences it, there might be potential for this app to become a template for others to share what their synesthesia is like, or examine it from a new perspective.
