# Synning

Synesthesia is an involuntary overlap of senses that remains consistent over time. For example, I experience sounds, letters, and numbers as distinct colors and units of time as shapes on a rotary. The "Synning" app is a crude experiment to see how closely I can translate my experience visually and share it with others. Synesthesia is differnet for everyone who experiences it, but maybe one day this app could become a fun sort of template for others to share what their synesthesia is like too, or examine it from a new perspective.
