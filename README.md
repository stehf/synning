# Synning

Synning came to life because I thought it would be interesting to share what having time-space synesthesia "looks like" with other people. It's not easy to explain with words, so why not come up with a way to visualize it? (I also wanted to pick a cool project to lean Vue.js with!)

## Progress log

### Fri 9/10/21
While I get the hang of Vue, the first step is grab the current date and change the background color of the page based on what day/month it is. The colors are flat right now but are a little more nuanced IRL, so gradients will come into play later on, as well as a "holistic" view of how I look at the shape/color of an entire year/decade, etc. This will take some experimentation to get right but so far looks promising!
