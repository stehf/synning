# Synning

Synning came to life because I experience time-space synesthesia, and it's challenging to explain exactly what that looks like to other people when they ask about it. With this project, I'm working on a way to visualize how it shows up for me. Since synesthesia is differnet for everyone who experiences it, this could potentially become a template for others to share their experience, and could be expanded to explore other types of synesthesia like space/time, or sound-to-color. (I also wanted to pick a cool project to learn Vue.js with!)
